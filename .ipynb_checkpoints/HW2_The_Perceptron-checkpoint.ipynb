    "ANS:- We use the code \"output = sigmoid(in_value) because it take the sigmoid value of dot product of weights and instance which is not the final output and weight is adjusted again which is known as back-propogatation and gives adjusted weight which helps to deduce final output that has higher accuracy but in the last code \"output = predict(weights, instance)\" gives the final and last output where the result is prepared upon adjusted weight and depending upon prediction perceptron weight cannot be adjusted.
